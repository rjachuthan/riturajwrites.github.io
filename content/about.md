Hello There. I am a humble data guy, your friendly neighborhood Data Engineer who occasionally dabbles in the world of Data Science.

I have an isatiable love for all things tech. You’ll often find me daydreaming about code, even though I struggle to find enough hours in the day to actually code. 😭 But don’t worry, I’m on a quest to change that!

Recently, I took the plunge into the fascinating realm of Linux, and let me tell you, I am hooked! 🐧 the GNU Philosophy has captured my heart, and I’m on a journey to explore the world of open source with a newfound passion.

I’ve got an ever-growing reading bucket list, filled with books, articles, and resources that I can’t wait to dive into. But, if I’m being honest, my procrastination game is strong. Maybe it’s time to level up my time management skills!

With this blog, I’m on a missing to force myself to learn in public. 💡 It’s a win-win situation! I get the motivation to expand my knowledge, and you get to join me on this adventure. Who knows, you might learn a thing or two from my experiences.

So, whether you’re a fellow tech enthusiast, a Linux aficianado, or just someone looking to pick up a few tips and tricks, welcome aboard!

Cheers to the wonderful world of data, tech and endless possibilities!
