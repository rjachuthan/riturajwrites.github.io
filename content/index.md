Welcome to my [[digital garden|Digital Garden]] 🌱, a humble corner of the internet where curiosity thrives and ideas take root. I'm just your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast, embarking on a journey through the vast realms of technology and knowledge.

You'll find me here, a humble data guy with an insatiable love for all things tech. From [[data engineering|Data Engineering]] to [[data science|Data Science]], and even a dive into the captivating world of [[linux|Linux]] 🐧, I'm on a quest to explore, learn, and share my discoveries with you.

But let's be real – I'm no coding wizard. Despite my daydreams filled with lines of code, I often find myself struggling to carve out enough time to make them a reality. Yet, fear not, for I'm determined to change that narrative! 😅

As I traverse this digital landscape, fueled by the GNU Philosophy and a newfound passion for open source, I invite you to join me. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just dipping your toes into the tech waters, there's something here for everyone.

But please be aware, my notes won't always be polished masterpieces. In this [[digital garden|Digital Garden]] 🌿, you'll encounter a mix of #🌱seedling concepts – tiny seeds waiting to sprout into fully-fledged ideas. As I nurture them, they'll blossom into #🌿budding insights, and eventually, if all goes well, they'll become #🌳evergreen treasures. 🌳

And what's a garden without pathways to guide you? Look out for my #MOC – Maps of Content – acting as central hubs to navigate through subjects like [[data engineering|Data Engineering]], [[data science|Data Science]], [[linux|Linux]], [Long Essays](/posts), [[programming|Programming]], [Book Notes](/books), and more.
