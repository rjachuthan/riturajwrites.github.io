Welcome to my [[digital garden|Digital Garden]] 🌱, a humble corner of the internet. You'll find me here, with an insatiable love for all things tech. From [[data engineering|Data Engineering]] to [[data science|Data Science]], [[ai]] and even a dive into the captivating world of [[linux|Linux]] 🐧, I'm on a quest to explore, learn, and share my discoveries with you.

But let's be real – I'm no coding wizard. Despite my daydreams filled with lines of code, I often find myself struggling to carve out enough time to make them a reality. Yet, fear not, for I'm determined to change that narrative! 😅

If you are interested in knowing why I have started to blog, I have shared that in detail here - [[why-am-i-blogging|Why am I Blogging?]]. I am pretty sure, whether you're a seasoned pro or just dipping your toes into the tech waters, there's something here for everyone.

But please be aware, my notes won't always be polished masterpieces. In this [[digital garden|Digital Garden]] 🌿, you'll encounter a mix of #🌱seedling concepts – tiny seeds waiting to sprout into fully-fledged ideas. As I nurture them, they'll blossom into #🌿budding insights, and eventually, if all goes well, they'll become #🌳evergreen treasures. 🌳🌳🌳🌳

And what's a garden without pathways to guide you? Look out for my #🗺️MOC – Maps of Content – acting as central hubs to navigate through subjects like:
- [[data engineering|Data Engineering]]
- [[data science|Data Science]]
- [[linux|Linux]]
- [Long Essays](/posts)
- [[programming|Programming]]
- [[content/books/index|Book Notes]], and more.
