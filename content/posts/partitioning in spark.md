Partitioning in [[apache spark|Spark]] is a crucial technique for organizing data efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets. When partitioning Parquet files, you're essentially dividing your data into subsets based on certain criteria, which can significantly improve query performance by allowing Spark to read only the relevant portions of the data.

1. **Understanding Partitioning**: Before diving into partitioning techniques, it's essential to understand your data and the query patterns. Partitioning should align with how your data is queried to maximize performance gains. It's common to partition by frequently filtered columns like date, region, or category.

2. **Using `partitionBy`**: In Spark, you can partition data while writing DataFrame to Parquet files using the `partitionBy` method. This method takes one or more column names as arguments and partitions the data based on those columns. For example:

   ```python
   df.write.partitionBy('date').parquet('path_to_write')
   ```

   This creates a directory structure where data is partitioned by the 'date' column.

3. **Choosing Partition Columns**: When selecting columns for partitioning, consider columns that have high cardinality (many distinct values). High cardinality columns ensure that each partition contains a reasonable amount of data, preventing skewed partitions and improving parallelism during query execution.

4. **Avoiding Too Many Partitions**: While partitioning improves query performance, having too many partitions can lead to overhead in metadata management and small file issues. Aim for a balance between query performance and overhead. You can control the number of partitions using techniques like `repartition` and `coalesce`.

5. **`repartition` vs. `coalesce`**:
	   - `repartition`: Used to increase or decrease the number of partitions in the DataFrame. It shuffles data across the cluster, which can be resource-intensive for large datasets.
	   - `coalesce`: Used to reduce the number of partitions without a full shuffle. It's more efficient than `repartition` for decreasing the number of partitions, but it doesn't allow you to increase partitions.

6. **Optimizing Partition Size**: `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` is a configuration parameter that specifies the maximum size of each partition in bytes when writing data to disk. It helps in controlling the size of individual files within each partition directory. Setting an appropriate value for this parameter ensures that partitions are neither too small (leading to many small files) nor too large (causing memory pressure during processing).

7. **Dynamic Partitioning**: Spark supports dynamic partitioning, where it automatically determines the partition columns based on the data being written. While convenient, dynamic partitioning can sometimes lead to unexpected partitioning schemes, so it's essential to validate the partitioning strategy.

8. **Managing Partition Overhead**: Keep an eye on the overhead introduced by partitioning, such as increased metadata storage and management complexity. Regularly monitor partition sizes, file counts, and overall storage usage to ensure efficient resource utilization.

In most cases you're bound on one of the following resources: memory, cpu, I/O bandwidth.

1. If you're limited on memory, select the # of partitions so that each node in your cluster has about 80% of its memory used. If memory usage is too low you'll waste time on the overhead of managing the extra partitions. If memory usage is too high you'll risk OOM errors. You can go higher than 80% but just be careful one of your nodes doesn't see any unexpected memory usage spike that kills your job.
    
2. If you're CPU bound select # of partitions equal to the # of cores in your cluster.
    
3. If you're I/O bandwidth bound use basically the same algorithm that you do for being memory bound, except choose the minimum number of partitions such that you max out the I/O capability of each node. You don't really need to cap this at 80% because maxing out I/O won't kill your job the same way an OOM will.
    

In the majority of cases I've found that my jobs are memory bound, but obviously there are exceptions.
