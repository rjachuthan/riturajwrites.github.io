Let's dive into the world of Low-Code/No Code [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]]. But before we do, let's set the stage with a bit of context on the [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] Process.

Traditional [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] is a complex and intricate process. It involves creating and maintaining architectures, [[database]]s, and processing systems that deal with vast amounts of data. Think of Data Engineers as the architects of data. They build pipelines that transform and transport data into a format that can be used by [[data_science|Data Scientist]]s. They are the ones who ensure the data is clean, reliable, and prepped for analysis. But this process is often time-consuming and requires a high level of technical expertise, which hampers the Development Workflow.

Enter [Low-Code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low-code_development_platform) [No-Code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/No-code_development_platform), an innovation in [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]]. I believe that this approach can simplify the process of data integration and processing. It allows individuals without a deep technical background to build and manage [[data_pipeline|Data Pipeline]]s. With a no-code platform, you can design your data workflows visually and automate the [[data_pipeline|Data Pipeline]] without writing a single line of code. It's like having a magic wand that turns complex data tasks into a series of simple, intuitive steps.

Now, you might be wondering why I, a humble blogger, decided to embark on the journey of creating a No Code [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] platform. Well, it's simple. I saw the challenges that traditional [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] posed and I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to democratize [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] by making it accesible to all. But, as with all great endeavors, there were bumps along the road. I faced failures and there were times when I wanted to throw in the towel. But every failure was a lesson learned and every setback, a stepping stone towards progress.

## Why Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering?

### Why are Companies Moving Towards a Low-Code/No-Code Approach for Data Engineering?

Firstly, let's talk about the **Democratization of technology**. Both low-code and no-code solutions are built with the objective of empowering different kinds of users. As [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/low-code-vs-no-code) puts it, these platforms are designed to make technology accessible to a wider audience, not just those with extensive coding skills. The importance of democratizing technology lies in its potential to foster widespread innovation, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities. By breaking down the barriers of technical complexity, these platforms enable a more diverse pool of minds to engage in technological exploration. A Javascript Developer, a newbie IT Analyst, and individuals with non-technical backgrounds can now actively contribute to the development of innovative solutions without the need for extensive coding knowledge. This democratization nurtures a culture of collaboration and inclusivity, where ideas from various perspectives converge, leading to the emergence of novel applications and cutting-edge advancements. This shift is breaking down barriers between technical and non-technical personnel. I've always held the belief that a product cannot truly succeed unless business users take an active interest in their IT solutions. In the context of [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]], this perspective becomes even more crucial.

Another reason for choosing a low-code/no-code platform is the **speed and efficiency** it offers. As [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/low-code-vs-no-code/) points out, no-code development is the fastest way to build and create solutions. It's also the most cost-effective and easiest to maintain over time. Using this framework which we have built, one of our junior developer has significantly improved his development speed. He has been delivering pipelines at a phenomenal speed.

### My Reasons for Moving to Low-Code/No-Code Setup

Imagine you're part of a relay race. You're running at breakneck speed, passing the baton, and just when you think you're about to cross the finish line, you're told to run the race again, but this time, backwards. That's what it feels like working in our fast-paced environment. We're juggling data gathering, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model creation, and oh, did I mention, we're also expected to whip up a high-quality [[data_pipeline|Data Pipeline]] in the same breath? No extensions. It's like being asked to bake a cake while simultaneously performing a ballet. And guess what? 80-90% of our time is spent on tasks that have nothing to do with [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]].

In the midst of this whirlwind, we often find ourselves creating what I like to call the 'Frankenstein's Monster' of code. It's either a '[God Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object)', a class that's bitten off more than it can chew, a '[Spaghetti Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)', a tangled mess that's as flexible as a brick, or a big '[Ball of Mud](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ball_of_Mud)', a code so convoluted that even Sherlock Holmes would have a hard time deciphering it. And these aren't just fancy terms I'm throwing around; they're real [Anti-Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) that haunt our deliverables.

  	<em><center>This is how a God Object works</center></em>

Now, let's talk about the wild west of **coding styles** in our company. Everyone's a cowboy, riding their own horse, following their own trail. It's like trying to understand an orchestra where every musician is playing a different tune. It's a nightmare for our Lead Engineers and Architects who have to review these 'masterpieces'.

And then there's the issue of **standardization**, or rather, the lack of it. It's like everyone's cooking their own version of a classic recipe. Take '[Base Price](https://analyticsstudent.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/baseline-sales-for-marketing-mix-modeling/)' in Media/Marketing Mix Modeling, for example. You'd think it's a standard calculation, right? Wrong. Every team has their own secret sauce, which works great for their dish but falls flat in others.

Lastly, let's not forget the elephant in the room - **good coding practices**. Or in our case, the lack thereof. It's like everyone's so busy juggling, they've forgotten to check if the balls they're juggling are even round. **Unit testing**? What's that? We're so caught up in writing functions for specific tasks that we've forgotten to make them reusable, let alone testable.

So, these are my main pain points. It's a wild ride, but hey, who said [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] was going to be a walk in the park? I would really like to have a Clean Code book just for [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]]/Data Science.

## Desired Features from the Framework

Imagine you're handed a magic wand that can transform complex [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] tasks into a walk in the park. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that's exactly what I envisioned when I set out to create this Framework. Let's take a peek into the magic box of features I had in mind.

### User-Friendly Interface and Configuration-Driven Design

The first thing I wanted to conjure up with my magic wand was a user-friendly interface. I decided to start with the heart of the system - the code packages. The idea was to create a robust foundation first and then wrap it up with a pretty bow, aka the User Interface. The entire [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] pipeline was to be defined as a configuration file. This file would be the master key, unlocking the source input file, defining its properties (CSV, Excel, Parquet, Delta format, you name it), and setting the parameters for reading the data.

Once the source dataset was read as a PySpark Dataframe, the configuration file would guide the transformations, validations, and finally, the write command. Now, I know what you're thinking. This configuration file could potentially become as long as a Tolstoy novel. And you're right.

I started off with JSON for the configuration file, but it soon started to resemble a plate of spaghetti with all the nested configs. So, I switched to YAML, which made the configuration file a bit more readalbe, if you would as me. Here's a sneak peek into one of the configuration files for a [[data_pipeline|Data Pipeline]].

```yaml
source:
  dataset_name: Sample Dataset
  read_path: <path to the file/folder location>
  read_format: parquet
  read_options:
    inferSchema: true

transformations:
  - stage_name: SelectColumnTransformer
    comment: Selecting only the required columns
    args:
      columns:
      - Country
      - State
      - City
      - Year
      - Population

  - stage_name: ColumnTransformer
    comment: Correct the values in Country Column
    args:
      columns:
      - column: Country
        expr: "CASE WHEN County = 'India' THEN 'IND' ELSE Country END"
      - column: Year
        expr: "int(Year)"

  - stage_name: GroupByTransformer
    comment: Get Aggregated values
    args:
      group_by:
       - Country
       - State
       - Year
      aggregations:
        Min_Population:
          column: Population
          agg: min
        Max_Population:
          column: Population
          agg: max
        Total_Population:
          column: Population
          agg: sum

write:
  file_name: <File Name>
  file_path: <Path to write>
```

I don't know about you, but this is pretty in my eyes. It looks prettier in a proper Text Editor as well. And yes, I hear you. This is still a configuration file, and someone has to write these configurations down. But hey, Rome wasn't built in a day. This was just the first step. Once I was happy with the framework, the plan was to work on creating a user-friendly interface with all the bells and whistles.

I know, I know, I could've started working on it in parallel. But here's a little secret: I don't know how to create a GUI with drag and drop functionalities.

### A One-Stop-Shop for Data Reading, Transformation, and Writing

This framework is a toolbox, which has each and every tool which is designed to perform a specific task in a given [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] process. That's exactly what I envisioned for my Low-Code/No-Code [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] Framework.

[[data_engineering|Data Engineering]], in its essence, is a series of tasks that can be broken down into smaller functions. Reading a single CSV file or multiple CSV files, reading Excel or Parquet files, fetching data from Microsoft SQL Server or Snowflake - these are all individual tasks. Then come the transformations - selecting columns, grouping by, ordering by, pivoting, unpivoting, filtering, adding or removing columns, and so on. Finally, we have the writing options - outputting the data as CSV, Parquet, Delta, or write to SQL. In my eyes, [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] is just these steps happening in various permutations and combinations from a desired list.

So, I placed each of these small units in a class, which is then called in the main pipeline. This approach has two main advantages:

**1. Extensibility**: This is the biggest advantage. Let's say someone wants to add a new functionality. With this framework, it's as simple as adding a new class for that particular functionality. This modular approach makes the system highly adaptable and scalable. It's like playing with Lego blocks - you can keep adding, removing, or rearranging the blocks to create whatever structure you want. The same goes for our [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] tasks. Need a new transformation function? Just create a new class. Need to read data from a new source? Add a class for that. The possibilities are endless.

**2. Good Coding Practices and Unit Testing**: The second benefit is that the data engineer using this framework doesn't have to worry about good coding practices or unit testing - all of that is already taken care of in the framework. It's like having a safety net. The developers just have to focus on writing pipelines and defining validation steps. This significantly reduces the cognitive load on the developers and allows them to focus on what they do best - engineering data.

## Next Chapter

As we turn the page on this chapter, I'm thrilled to share that our story of building the Low-Code/No-Code [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] Framework isn't a tale of fiction. It's a reality, it's tangible, and it's ready to be put into action.

But don't close the book just yet! We're merely at the end of a chapter, not the whole story. We've set the scene for a new development workflow and introduced our characters. Now, it's time for the plot to thicken.

In the next chapter (or rather, the next article), we'll delve deeper into the heart of the narrative. We'll explore the intricacies of the code, the twists and turns of our journey, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. We'll also share the reviews and feedback from the brave team members who've been using this framework, and see whether this has really democratized [[data_engineering|Data Engineering]] processes or not!

So, keep your bookmark ready, sit back, and get ready for the next chapter. What are you most excited to learn about in our journey?
