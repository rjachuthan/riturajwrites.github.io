Data governance involves the establishment of policies, procedures, and responsibilities to manage and oversee the quality, security, and usage of data within an organization. It includes defining data ownership, data stewardship, and data quality standards to ensure data integrity and compliance with regulations. Effective data governance ensures that data is reliable, accessible, and protected from unauthorized access or breaches. It also helps in aligning data management practices with business objectives, improving data decision-making, and facilitating data integration across different systems. By implementing a robust data governance framework, organizations can better manage their data assets and mitigate risks associated with data misuse.
