Medallion Architecture is a modern data architecture framework that structures data into three distinct layers, often referred to as bronze, silver, and gold.
- The bronze layer serves as the raw data ingestion layer, where data from various sources is collected in its original format, allowing for flexibility and comprehensive data capture.
- The silver layer is the transformation layer, where the data is cleaned, enriched, and organized for more efficient querying and analysis.
- The gold layer represents the curated, high-quality data ready for analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

This layered approach promotes modularity and scalability, making it easier to manage large volumes of data and adapt to changing business requirements. By separating the stages of data processing, Medallion Architecture allows organizations to implement robust data governance practices, improve data quality, and facilitate advanced analytics, such as machine learning and business intelligence.
