title: Junk Dimension
description: A junk dimension is a dimension table in a data warehouse that consolidates low-cardinality attributes or flags that do not fit naturally into existing dimensions. It helps simplify the data model by reducing the number of dimension tables and can improve query performance and maintainability by grouping related attributes together. Junk dimensions are typically used for convenience and to avoid creating numerous small dimensions for each low-cardinality attribute.
