Software as a Service (SaaS) is a [[cloud computing|Cloud]]-based delivery model that enables users to access software applications via the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance. In the SaaS model, applications are hosted on the service provider's servers, and users can interact with them through a web browser or dedicated interface. This approach provides several advantages, including ease of access, automatic updates, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, as users typically pay on a subscription basis rather than making large upfront investments in software licenses. SaaS is widely used across various industries for applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), human resources management, and collaboration tools. The SaaS model allows businesses to focus on their core operations while leveraging the latest software capabilities, fostering innovation and enhancing productivity.
