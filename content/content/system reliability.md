System reliability is a critical aspect of software engineering and systems design, focusing on the dependability and consistent performance of a system in meeting user expectations and operational requirements. It encompasses various factors, including hardware reliability, software robustness, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms.

Reliability is often quantified using metrics such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), which help organizations understand the expected performance and maintenance needs of their systems. To enhance system reliability, engineers employ practices such as redundancy, error detection and correction, comprehensive testing, and monitoring. Additionally, reliability engineering principles guide the design and implementation of systems to minimize the likelihood of failures and improve overall uptime. Achieving high system reliability is essential for maintaining user trust, ensuring business continuity, and optimizing resource utilization in various applications, from critical infrastructure to enterprise software.
