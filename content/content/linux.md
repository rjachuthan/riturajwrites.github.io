Linux is an open-source operating system that is built around the Linux kernel, first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Its open-source nature allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code, fostering a large community of developers who contribute to its continuous improvement. Linux is known for its flexibility and can be customized to fit various needs, making it a popular choice for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Its architecture supports multi-user and multitasking environments, providing strong security features, such as user permissions and process isolation. Various distributions (distros), such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, cater to different user needs, ranging from beginner-friendly interfaces to specialized server environments. Linux is widely used in web servers, supercomputers, and mobile devices (Android), and it forms the backbone of many cloud computing infrastructures.
