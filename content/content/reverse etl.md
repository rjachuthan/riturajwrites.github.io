Reverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a data integration process that involves moving data from a centralized [[data warehouse]] back to operational systems, such as CRM, marketing platforms, or ERP systems. While traditional [[etl|ETL]] focuses on transferring data into a warehouse for analysis, reverse ETL aims to operationalize insights derived from data analytics by making them accessible to business users in their daily workflows. This process typically involves extracting relevant data from the data warehouse, transforming it to meet the requirements of the target systems, and loading it into those systems for use.

Reverse ETL is particularly valuable in enabling data-driven decision-making, improving customer engagement, and automating business processes by ensuring that actionable insights are readily available where they are needed most. As organizations increasingly rely on data to inform their operations, reverse ETL plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between analytics and execution.
