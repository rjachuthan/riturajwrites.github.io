title: Reverse ETL
description: "Reverse ETL is a data integration process where data flows from a data warehouse or data lake back to operational systems or other downstream applications. Unlike traditional ETL processes that move data from source systems to a centralized data repository, reverse ETL focuses on extracting insights or processed data from the centralized repository and delivering it to operational systems or other business applications for operational use.
