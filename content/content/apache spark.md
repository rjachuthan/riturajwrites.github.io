> [!IMPORTANT] What is Spark
> Apache Spark is a unified Computing Engine and a set of Libraries for Parallel Data Processing on computer clusters.

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine designed for big data processing and analytics. It provides an in-memory data processing capability that enhances the speed and efficiency of data operations compared to traditional disk-based processing systems like Hadoop MapReduce. Spark supports a wide range of data processing tasks, including batch processing, interactive queries, real-time streaming, and machine learning. Its core components include Spark SQL for querying structured data, Spark Streaming for real-time data processing, MLlib for machine learning, and GraphX for graph processing. Spark's ability to handle diverse data workloads in a distributed manner makes it a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large datasets across clusters.
