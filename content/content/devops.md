DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that aims to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams to accelerate the software development lifecycle. It emphasizes automation of processes such as [[continuous integration]], [[continuous delivery]] (CI/CD), and infrastructure management to streamline and speed up software releases. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility and collaboration, DevOps seeks to improve software quality, reduce deployment time, and ensure more reliable and efficient operations. Key practices include using version control systems, automated testing, and infrastructure as code (IaC) to facilitate smoother and more predictable software delivery.
