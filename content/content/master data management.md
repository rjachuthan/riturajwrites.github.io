Master Data Management (MDM) is a strategic approach that focuses on creating a single, authoritative source of truth for an organization's master data, which includes key entities such as customers, products, suppliers, and locations. MDM processes help to maintain the quality and integrity of this data across various systems, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy. Implementing MDM typically involves [[data governance]] practices, [[data modeling]], and the use of specialized MDM tools and technologies. Effective MDM enhances [[data quality]] by establishing standards and workflows for data creation, maintenance, and usage, allowing organizations to make informed decisions based on accurate information. By providing a unified view of master data, MDM supports better analytics, improves operational efficiency, and enhances customer experiences across all business functions.
