GitHub Copilot is an AI-driven tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, designed to assist developers by providing context-aware code suggestions and completions. It integrates with popular code editors like Visual Studio Code and uses machine learning models to understand the code you are writing and predict subsequent lines or entire functions. By analyzing vast amounts of code from various sources, Copilot can generate code snippets, suggest improvements, and offer documentation. This tool aims to boost productivity by reducing the need for manual coding and helping developers overcome coding challenges more efficiently.
