Generative AI encompasses a range of techniques and models designed to generate new data, content, or structures that resemble real-world examples. These techniques use algorithms to learn patterns and features from large datasets and then create novel outputs, such as images, text, music, or even code. Examples include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consist of two neural networks contesting with each other to improve generation quality, and transformer models like GPT, which generate human-like text. Generative AI has applications in creative fields, content creation, and data augmentation, offering innovative ways to produce and interact with digital content.
