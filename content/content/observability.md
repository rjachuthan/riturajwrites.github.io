Observability refers to the extent to which the internal state of a system can be inferred from its external outputs, such as logs, metrics, and traces. In the context of software systems, especially distributed architectures like [[microservices]], observability enables organizations to monitor application performance, identify issues, and diagnose problems in real-time.

Key components of observability include:
- logging (capturing detailed information about system events)
- metrics (quantitative measurements of system performance)
- distributed tracing (tracking requests as they flow through various services)

Together, these elements provide comprehensive insights into system behavior, helping teams proactively manage performance and reliability. Effective observability is essential for maintaining system health, enabling rapid response to incidents, and fostering continuous improvement through data-driven decision-making.
