A data mart is a specialized, smaller-scale data repository within a [[data warehouse]] environment, tailored to meet the analytical and reporting needs of a specific business unit, such as sales, finance, or marketing. It focuses on a particular subject area or department, providing a more targeted and efficient way to access relevant data. Data marts are often used to improve query performance and simplify data access for end-users by concentrating on specific datasets and metrics. They can be created from [[data warehouse]]s through data extraction, transformation, and loading ([[etl|ETL]]) processes or directly from operational systems. By focusing on specific business needs, data marts help streamline reporting and decision-making processes.
