A data catalog serves as a centralized repository for metadata, which includes information about the data's origin, structure, usage, and relationships. It helps organizations manage their data assets by providing a searchable interface where users can find, understand, and access data. Features of a data catalog typically include data lineage tracking, data quality metrics, and access controls. By offering detailed descriptions and documentation, data catalogs enhance data governance, improve data discovery, and facilitate better data management practices. They are crucial for organizations aiming to leverage their data effectively and ensure compliance with data regulations and standards.
