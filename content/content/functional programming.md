title: Functional Programming
description: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutability, enabling developers to write concise, declarative, and composable code that is easier to reason about and test.
