Flow state, also known as being "in the zone," is a psychological phenomenon where individuals experience deep engagement and concentration during an activity. Achieving flow involves a balance between the challenge of the task and the individual's skill level, leading to heightened focus, intrinsic motivation, and a sense of effortless control. People in a flow state often lose track of time and are highly productive and creative. This concept, introduced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is important in various fields, including psychology, sports, and workplace productivity, as it helps in understanding how to enhance performance and well-being by fostering conditions that facilitate flow.
