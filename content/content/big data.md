Big data encompasses vast amounts of information generated from various sources such as social media, sensors, transactions, and more. These datasets are characterized by their volume (size), velocity (speed of generation), and variety (different types of data). Managing and analyzing big data involves using specialized technologies and frameworks to extract meaningful insights and patterns. Tools like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and various NoSQL databases are commonly used to handle big data challenges. The goal is to leverage this data to drive decision-making, improve business processes, and uncover new opportunities in fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
