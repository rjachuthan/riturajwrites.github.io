Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet. Instead of owning the physical hardware and managing software locally, users can access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more through a cloud services provider.

These services are typically offered on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing users to scale resources up or down according to their needs without having to invest in and maintain physical infrastructure.

# Types of Cloud Computing

1. **[[iaas|Infrastructure-as-a-Service]]**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. For example, Virtual machines, storage etc.
2. **[[paas|Platform-as-a-Service]]**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. For example, Database Management Systems, Microsoft Azure App Services
3. **[[saas|Software-as-a-Service]]**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. For example, Microsoft Office 365
4. **Function-as-a-Service**: 
5. **Storage-as-a-Service**: 
6. **Database-as-a-Service**: 
7. **Desktop-as-a-Service**: 

# Characteristics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing encompasses several key characteristics that define its fundamental principles and capabilities:

- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, on-demand without requiring human intervention from the service provider.
- **Broad Network Access**: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from various devices.
- **Resource Pooling**: Computing resources are pooled and shared among multiple users to achieve economies of scale. The cloud's infrastructure dynamically allocates and manages resources, ensuring optimal utilization without users needing to know the exact physical location of the resources.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Cloud resources can be rapidly scaled up or down to accommodate changes in demand. This elasticity enables users to adjust their resource allocation in real-time, ensuring they have the capacity they need without over-provisioning or under-provisioning.
- **Measured Service**: Cloud computing resources are metered, and users are billed based on their actual usage.
- **Scalability**: Cloud services can easily scale to handle varying levels of workload without requiring significant changes to the underlying infrastructure.
- **Resilience and Reliability**: Cloud providers typically offer redundant infrastructure and data replication to ensure high availability and data durability.
- **Security**: Cloud providers implement robust security measures to protect data and infrastructure from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This includes encryption, identity and access management, network security, and compliance with industry standards and regulations, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of users' data and applications.
