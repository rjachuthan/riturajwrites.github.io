Apache Mesos is a powerful open-source cluster management system designed to manage resources across a large number of machines in a distributed environment. It provides an abstraction layer for CPU, memory, and storage resources, allowing developers to deploy and scale applications seamlessly.

Mesos uses a two-level scheduling mechanism, where resource offers are made to frameworks (such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, or Docker) that can then schedule tasks based on the resources available. This flexibility enables Mesos to support a variety of workloads, from batch processing to long-running services, making it an ideal choice for [[big data]] applications and [[microservices]] architectures.

By simplifying the management of complex clusters, Mesos enhances resource utilization, reduces operational overhead, and improves application performance.
