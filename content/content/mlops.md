MLOps is a discipline that aims to unify [[machine learning]] development and operations by applying DevOps principles to the [[machine learning]] lifecycle. It encompasses practices for collaboration, automation, and monitoring of [[machine learning]] workflows, from data preparation and model training to deployment and maintenance. MLOps facilitates [[continuous integration]] and [[continuous delivery]] (CI/CD) for [[machine learning]] models, allowing teams to rapidly iterate and improve models while ensuring consistent performance in production environments.

Key components of MLOps include:
- version control for datasets and models,
- automated testing
- monitoring of model performance to detect data drift and model degradation over time.

By implementing MLOps, organizations can enhance collaboration between [[data science|Data Scientist]] and operations teams, reduce time to market for [[machine learning]] applications, and improve the reliability and scalability of their [[machine learning]] solutions.
