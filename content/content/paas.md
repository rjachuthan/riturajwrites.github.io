Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a [[cloud computing]] service model that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider delivers a complete platform that includes computing resources, development tools, middleware, database management systems, and more, all accessible over the internet.
