title: Data Lakehouse
description: A data lakehouse combines the benefits of a data lake (scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness for storing raw and unstructured data) with those of a data warehouse (structured querying, transactional integrity, and performance optimizations), providing a unified platform for both operational and analytical workloads in modern data architectures.

A data lakehouse is an architecture that merges the benefits of [[data lake]] and [[data warehouse]] into a single platform. It enables the storage of large volumes of raw, unstructured data (as in a data lake) while also supporting the management and querying of structured data with high performance and reliability (as in a [[data warehouse]]). This approach provides the flexibility of [[data lake]]s for handling diverse data types and the transactional capabilities and schema enforcement of [[data warehouse]]s. By integrating these features, a data lakehouse facilitates efficient data processing, analytics, and reporting, allowing organizations to streamline their data infrastructure and reduce data movement between systems.
