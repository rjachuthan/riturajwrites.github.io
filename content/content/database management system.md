A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that provides tools for managing and interacting with [[database]]s. It handles various tasks, such as data storage, retrieval, updating, and administration, allowing users to efficiently manage and query data. DBMSs support various types of databases, including relational databases (using SQL), NoSQL databases (for unstructured data), and more. They offer features like data integrity, security, backup, and recovery, and often provide user interfaces and APIs for interacting with the data. By abstracting the complexity of data management, a DBMS enables users and applications to access and manipulate data in a structured and organized manner.
