Machine learning (ML) is a branch of [[ai|Artificial Intelligence]] that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being programmed to perform a specific task, machine learning algorithms learn from historical data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time.

ML is broadly categorized into [[supervised learning]], [[unsupervised learning]], and [[reinforcement learning]]. In [[supervised learning]], algorithms are trained on labeled data to make predictions, while [[unsupervised learning]] identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data. And [[reinforcement learning]] involves agents that learn to make decisions through trial and error to maximize rewards. Applications of machine learning span various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, making it a powerful tool for transforming data into actionable insights.
