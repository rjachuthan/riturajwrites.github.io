Data engineering is the design and construction of systems tailored for the collection, storage, and analysis of data on a large scale. This discipline spans across various industries due to the ubiquitous nature of data. With the capacity to amass vast quantities of data, organizations rely on adept individuals and advanced technology to ensure its usability for data scientists and analysts.

Key responsibilities of a data engineer include:
- Acquiring datasets aligned with business objectives.
- Developing algorithms to translate raw data into actionable insights.
- Constructing, testing, and maintaining robust [[data pipeline]] architectures.
- Collaborating with management to grasp organizational goals.
- Innovating new [[data validation]] techniques and analytical tools.
- Ensuring adherence to [[data governance]] and security protocols.

However, paramount among these duties is the establishment of resilient [[data pipeline]]s. These pipelines should operate flawlessly, continuously extracting, loading, and transforming data, provided that foundational conditions are unchanged.
