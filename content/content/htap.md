Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) is a modern [[database]] architecture that combines the capabilities of [[oltp|Online Transaction Processing]] (OLTP) and [[olap|Online Analytical Processing]] (OLAP) within a single system.

Traditionally, OLTP systems handle high-frequency, short-duration transactions, while OLAP systems are optimized for complex queries and data analysis. By integrating both, HTAP enables real-time analytics on live transactional data without the need for data replication or transfer to a separate analytical system. This approach significantly reduces data latency, enhances decision-making, and improves overall system performance by allowing organizations to perform complex analytics on fresh, operational data. HTAP systems are especially beneficial in environments where rapid data insights are crucial, such as financial services, e-commerce, and IoT applications.
