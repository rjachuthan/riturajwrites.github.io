An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a robust software tool that combines several programming utilities into a single, cohesive interface to streamline the development process. It typically includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Many IDEs offer additional features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and version control integration to improve productivity and code quality. Popular IDEs like Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse support various programming languages and frameworks, providing an all-in-one solution that helps developers write, test, and debug their code efficiently.

But these days, you can setup your text editors like VS Code and NeoVim to perform the same tasks as IDEs. So, the lines between Text Editors and IDEs have become a little blurry.
