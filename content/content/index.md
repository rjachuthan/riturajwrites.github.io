In my [[digital garden]], a "**Seedling**" is a tag assigned to notes that have just begun to take shape. These notes are the starting points for ideas, topics, or concepts that I find intriguing but have not yet fully developed. Just like young plants, these seedlings have the potential to grow and evolve into more detailed and comprehensive notes. As I delve deeper into these topics and gather more insights, I will nurture these seedlings, eventually maturing them into "**Budding**" notes that are more fully fleshed out.

Page page is a **Seedbox** of all the Seedlings you will find that I have sown in my digital garden. They are the nascent stages of ideas, waiting to be explored and cultivated. Feel free to browse through these seedlings to see the beginnings of thoughts and concepts that may soon blossom into detailed entries.
