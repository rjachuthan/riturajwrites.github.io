Deep learning involves training artificial neural networks with many layers (also known as deep neural networks) to perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Unlike traditional machine learning, which relies on feature engineering, deep learning automatically extracts features from raw data through its hierarchical layers. This capability allows it to handle large volumes of data and model intricate patterns, making it particularly effective for tasks like speech recognition, image classification, and complex game playing. Deep learning models require substantial computational power and large datasets but offer state-of-the-art performance in various applications.
