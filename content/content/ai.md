Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. This includes abilities such as learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI technologies leverage algorithms and data to emulate cognitive functions, enabling machines to improve their performance over time. AI applications span various domains, including robotics, [[nlp|natural language processing]], and [[predictive analytics]], and are increasingly integrated into everyday technologies, enhancing both personal and professional experiences.
