Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) refers to a class of systems designed to handle a large number of short online transactions, such as order entry, financial transactions, and inventory management. OLTP systems are optimized for speed and efficiency, enabling multiple users to perform transactions simultaneously while maintaining data integrity and consistency. Key features of OLTP systems include ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensure reliable transaction processing. These systems typically use relational databases to store data, allowing for structured query language (SQL) operations to insert, update, and delete records. The focus of OLTP is on fast query response times, minimal transaction latency, and the ability to handle concurrent user interactions. OLTP systems are widely used in various industries, including banking, e-commerce, and telecommunications, where rapid data processing is crucial for business operations.
