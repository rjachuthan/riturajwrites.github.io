title: OLAP System
description: OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are database management systems optimized for complex analytical queries and multidimensional analysis of large datasets. They allow users to analyze data from multiple perspectives, such as time, geography, product, or customer, by organizing data into multidimensional structures called cubes. OLAP systems typically support interactive and ad-hoc querying, enabling users to explore and analyze data dynamically to gain insights and make informed decisions.
