A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualization technology that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, referred to as the host. Each VM operates in its own isolated environment, running its own operating system and applications, which provides users with the flexibility to create, manage, and utilize various configurations without the need for additional hardware. VMs are created using hypervisor software, such as VMware, Hyper-V, or KVM, which manages the allocation of physical resources (CPU, memory, storage) to each VM. This technology is widely used for various purposes, including server consolidation, development and testing environments, disaster recovery, and cloud computing. By enabling resource pooling and efficient hardware utilization, virtual machines help organizations reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, VMs can be easily replicated, backed up, and migrated, making them a vital component of modern IT infrastructure.
