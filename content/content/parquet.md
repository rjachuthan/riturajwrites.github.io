Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar file format developed for efficient data storage and retrieval in [[big data]] environments. It is designed to work well with various data processing frameworks, such as [[apache spark|Apache Spark]], [[apache hive|Apache Hive]], and [[apache impala|Apache Impala]], making it a popular choice for analytics and [[data warehouse]]-ing applications. The columnar storage approach allows Parquet to store data in a way that is optimized for reading and writing, leading to improved performance for analytical queries and reduced storage costs. Parquet supports advanced features such as schema evolution, compression, and partitioning, which enhance its efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, because it is built on open standards, Parquet is compatible with a variety of programming languages and data processing tools, facilitating interoperability in diverse data ecosystems. This makes it an ideal choice for organizations looking to store and analyze large volumes of structured and semi-structured data efficiently.
