Chaos engineering is a *disciplined approach* to identifying and mitigating potential failures in a system by intentionally injecting faults and observing how the system responds. It aims to ensure that systems can withstand unexpected disruptions and maintain their performance and reliability.

## Key Principles of Chaos Engineering

1. **Hypothesize about steady state behavior**: Define what a normal, healthy state of your system looks like in terms of performance metrics and data quality.
2. **Simulate real-world failures**: Introduce controlled failures that mimic potential real-world issues.
3. **Run experiments in production**: Test the system in its actual working environment to observe genuine reactions.
4. **Automate experiments**: Use automation to run chaos experiments continuously or at regular intervals.
5. **Minimize blast radius**: Start with small, controlled experiments to reduce the risk of causing significant disruption.
