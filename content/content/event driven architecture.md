title: Event Driven Architecture
description: Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern where the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events are central to the architecture. It enables loosely coupled systems by allowing components to communicate asynchronously through the exchange of events, facilitating scalability, resilience, and responsiveness in distributed systems.
