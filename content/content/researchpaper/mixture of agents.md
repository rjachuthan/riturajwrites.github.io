The primary objective of this research is to enhance the capabilities of [[llm|Large Language Model]] by leveraging the collective strengths of multiple models through a [[mixture of agents|Mixture-of-Agents]] (MoA) approach. The core ideas is that different LLMs have unique strengths, and by combining their outputs, the overall response quality can be significantly improved. The authors bet on the *collaborativeness of LLMs* and how some LLMs excels in complex instruction following while other may be better suited for code generation. The researchers have noticed that an LLM tends to generate better responses when presented with outputs from other modes, even if these other models are less capable by itself.

# Mixture-of-Agents

The main question this research paper is trying to answer is: *"Can we harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs to create a more capable and robust model?"* And they have proven that it is possible.

## Framework

The Mixture of Agents (MoA) framework is a novel approach designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) through an iterative refinement process. This structure is built on the concept of multiple agents, each specialized in different aspects of the task at hand, working together in a coordinated manner.

When these models are provided with answers generated independently by these models, their LC win rates significantly improve. Initially, LLMs in the first layer, independently generate responses to a given prompt. These responses are then presented to agents in the next layer (which may reuse a model from the first layer) for further refinement. This iterative refinement process continues for several cycles until obtaining a more robust and comprehensive response.

## Collaborativeness of LLMs

Many of today's available LLMs exhibit collaborative capabilities and MoA capitalizes that for its benefit. In the MoA framework, agents are organized into layers, each with a distinct function. The process begins with a layer of **proposers**, which are LLMs tasked with generating initial responses or solutions to a given problem. While a good proposer may not necessarily produce responses with high scores by itself, but it should offer more context and diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to better final response when used by an aggregator.

These initial outputs are then passed to a layer of **aggregators**, which review, critique, and integrate the proposals. Aggregators are models proficient in synthesizing responses from other models into a single, high quality output. An effective aggregator should maintain or enhance output quality even when integrating inputs from lesser quality than its own.

## What Mixture-of-Agents to Use?

It is important to note that LLMs can be reused either within the same layer or across different layers. When many LLMs in a layer are identical, this configuration leads to a special structure that corresponds to a model generating multiple possibly different outputs (due to the stochasticity of temperature sampling).

In the final layer, in practice, we do not need to concatenate prompt and all models responses so only one LLM is needed to be used in the last layer. Below is a really good prompt from the paper which the authors have used in the final layer of the framework:

> [!example] Aggregate-and-Synthesize Prompt to integrate responses from other models
> You have been provided with a set of responses from various open-source models to the latest user query. Your task is to synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response. It is crucial to critically evaluate the information provided in these responses, recognizing that some of it may be biased or incorrect. Your response should not simply replicate the given answers but should offer a refined, accurate, and comprehensive reply to the instruction. Ensure your response is well-structured, coherent, and adheres to the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.

# What Are the Claims Made in the Paper

There were several claims made in the research papers and I would like to go through them one by one to see if they hold true or if they have any gaps in them.

## **Claim 1**: SOTA?

The paper says that the Mixture-of-Agents achieves State-of-the-Art performance on bechmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and FLASK Eval. (Score B)

### Claim Support Evidence:

- **AlpacaEval 2.0:** MoA achieved a win rate of 65.1%, surpassing GPT-4 Omniâ€™s 57.5% .
- **MT-Bench:** MoA achieved an average score of 9.25, compared to GPT-4 Omni's 9.19 .
- **FLASK:** MoA outperformed GPT-4 Omni in aspects like robustness, correctness, factuality, and insightfulness .

### Claim Refutation Evidence:

- **Limited context:** The benchmarks cited focus on specific aspects of model performance, potentially overlooking other important factors .
- **Methodological consistency:** Variability in evaluation criteria and methods might affect the comparability of results.

### Logical Fallacies:

- **Cherry-picking:** Focusing on specific benchmarks where MoA performs well might ignore cases where it does not excel.
- **Confirmation bias:** Using benchmarks that align with the MoA's strengths could bias the evaluation results

## **Claim 2**: LLMs Exhibit Collaborativenss?

LLMs exhibit collaborativeness, generating better responses when provided with outputs from other models. (Score B)

### Claim Support Evidence:

- **Data in this figure:** LC win rates improve for various LLMs when using responses from other models.

![https://arxiv.org/html/2406.04692v1/x1.png](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.04692v1/x1.png)

- **Proposers and Aggregators:** The study shows that combining responses (aggregators) from multiple models improves final output quality .

### Claim Refutation Evidence:

- **Subjectivity:** Improvement in response quality is assessed using subjective measures, potentially introducing bias .
- **Benchmark Limitation:** Results might vary with different or more diverse benchmarks .

### Logical Fallacies

- **Hasty Generalization:** Generalizing the collaborativeness phenomenon based on limited data and benchmarks.
- **Appeal to Novelty:** Assuming new collaborative methods are better without sufficient comprehensive evidence.

## **Claim 3**: Cost Effective?

MoA is cost-effective compared to models like GPT-4 Turbo while achieving similar performance. (Score C)

### Claim Support Evidence:

- **Budget Analysis:** MoA delivers comparable performance to GPT-4 Turbo but is approximately 2Ã— more cost-effective .
- **MoA-Lite:** A variant of MoA achieves a 1.8% improvement in quality on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to GPT-4o while being more cost-effective .

### Claim Refutation Evidence:

- **Cost Metrics:** The definition and measurement of cost-effectiveness can vary, potentially affecting conclusions .
- **Performance Scope:** Cost-effectiveness might not hold true across all tasks and benchmarks .

### Logical Fallacies:

- **Equivocation:** Using ambiguous definitions of cost-effectiveness without clear metrics.
- **Overgeneralization:** Assuming cost-effectiveness in specific scenarios applies universally.

## Overall Claim Analysis

The argument for MoA is robust with substantial empirical support, though limited by selective evidence and subjective metrics. Further independent validation and diverse benchmarks could strengthen these claims and provide a more comprehensive understanding of MoA's effectiveness and efficiency.
