Data mesh is an architectural paradigm that shifts away from centralized data management by distributing data ownership across different domains or business units. Instead of relying on a central data team or [[data warehouse]], each domain is responsible for its own data products and infrastructure, creating a more scalable and flexible data ecosystem. This approach encourages domain teams to manage, own, and operate their own data products, which enhances data quality and relevance while reducing bottlenecks associated with central data teams. Data mesh emphasizes the use of standardized data interfaces and interoperability to ensure that data from various domains can be integrated and accessed seamlessly across the organization.
